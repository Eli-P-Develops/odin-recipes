          <li class="method">Place a steak in the middle of a cutting board, then wrap it in plastic wrap. Pound the steak evenly to a thickness of 1/4 inch with a meat mallet. Season with salt and pepper on both sides. Repeat this process for each steak</li>
          <li class="method">Whisk together the eggs and 1 cup of milk in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the 1 1/2 cups of flour, pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a separate shallow bowl</li>
          <li class="method">The steaks should be first dredged in the flour mixture, then dip into the egg mixture and allow any extra egg to drip off. Repeatedly coat with the flour mixture. Wait 10-15 minutes for the coating to dry out</li>
          <li class="method">Heat the oil in a 10-inch pan over medium-high heat until it reaches 375˚F</li>
          <li class="method">Fry the steaks, 2 at a time, for 3 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook on the other side for 3 minutes more. The steaks should be golden brown and cooked through. Check internal temperature for around 155˚-165˚F, then transfer the steaks to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet and season with salt. Once all of the steaks are done frying, transfer to the oven and begin preparing the gravy</li>
          <li class="method">Pour the hot oil into a heatproof bowl and let cool before discarding. 9. Leave any browned bits in the pan</li>
